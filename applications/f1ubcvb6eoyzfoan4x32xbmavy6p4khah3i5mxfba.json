    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced.\r\nHRRR implementations at NCEP\r\nHRRRv1 - 30 Sept 2014\r\nHRRRv2 - 23 Aug 2016\r\nHRRRv3 - 12 July 2018\r\nHRRRv4 - 2 Dec 2020",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is sourced by Global System Laboratory from National Oceanic && Atmospheric Administration. It is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh.\r\nHRRR dataset stored on AWS is the archive since 2014 with a total size of 2PiB and 38526457 Object.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe, Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03028318 \r\nf03028326\r\nf02363308\r\nf02820572\r\nf03028325\r\nf03028310\r\nf03028315\r\nf02829747 \r\nf02807399\r\nf02916995 \r\nf02078669\r\nf02363306   \r\nf02917080\r\nf02934915 \r\nf02934916\r\nf02934869   \r\nf02934879",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
