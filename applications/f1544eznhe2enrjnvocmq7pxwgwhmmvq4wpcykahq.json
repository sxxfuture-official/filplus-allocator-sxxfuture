    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Library started as a shelf of books in the Surgeon General’s office in 1836 but has grown to a collection of millions of print and electronic resources. The diverse centers, divisions, advisory bodies and other organizational units that make up NLM contribute in myriad ways to the Library’s mission.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Sequence Read Archive (SRA), produced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), stores raw DNA sequencing data and alignment information from high-throughput sequencing platforms. The SRA provides open access to these biological sequence data to support the research community's efforts to enhance reproducibility and make new discoveries by comparing data sets. Buckets in this registry contain public SRA data in the original (user submitted) format from select high value and newly-released studies as well as all public-access SRA formatted ETL+BQS data. Also included is all SRA metadata that can be leveraged for attribute-based data discovery.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We would use Lotus to prepare data.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "arn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-src-1\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://sra-pub-src-1/\r\narn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-src-2\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://sra-pub-src-2/\r\narn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-run-odp\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://sra-pub-run-odp/\r\narn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-metadata-us-east-1/sra/metadata\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://sra-pub-metadata-us-east-1/sra/metadata/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Weekly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02816097/HK\r\nf03233966/ZJ\r\nf03192503/HK\r\nf03231666/SC\r\nf03066836/HN\r\nWill add more in the future.",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
